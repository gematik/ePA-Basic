  title: Authorization Service
  description: |
    This interface provides access to Authorization Service.</br>
    Through this interface, client systems can carry out user authentication. There are two different ways
    - Authentication of the insurant or representative using the insurant's device through sectoral IDP of 
    the health insurance company
    - Authentication of client systems through the central IDP (IDP-Dienst)
    - Authentication by bearer token (erp-backend)

    **General conditions**:</br> 
    For all operations if applicable:
    - error responses may be extended by helpful information about the error condition in _errorDetail_

    **Prereqisites**:</br>
    For insurant and representatives
    - The sectoral IDP of Health insurance is registered with the TI-Federation
    - The authorization service of a Health Record System is registered with the TI-Federation (clientid)
    - The authenticator modul of the sectoral IDP is part of the frontend application on insurant's device 
    
    For other client systems
    - The authorization service of the Health Record System is registered with the central IDP 
    (IDP-Dienst)

    **Retry interval**:</br>
    The following retry intervals are suggested in case of an error response:<br>
    - '500' Internal Error
      - approx. 10 minutes

  description: |
   Authorization with an ePA-FdV client for insurants and representatives and login to a health 
   record system.
   
   This authorization method addresses a sectoral IDP of the federation associated
   to the health insurance providing the health record. The authentication of a user towards the 
   IDP is itself a task of the Authenticator associated to 
   the IDP and available on client side. Each client shall maintain the address of its associated IDP 
   (idp-iss) for operations of this interface.

   A successful login provides an IDToken and causes an authorized epa user session allowing access to the 
   associated health record as insurant (health record owner) or representative.
  
   A client shall perform an explicite logout operation after use to release the user session and its resources.
   
   All operations mandate an established VAU-channel.

   **ePA Device Binding**</br>
   The last (internal) action of the Authorization Service after successful (internal) receiption of an IDToken
   is the epa device binding check:</br>
   
   Registered devices:</br>
   Clients shall provide device identification parameters from a (previous) device registration with each login 
   attempt (in _sendAuthCodeFdV_).
   A login for health record access only succeeds in case the device is registered in the device management 
   service for the user of the device.

   New or unknown device:</br>
   In case a new (not yet registered) device is used, no device paramteres shall be provided for login. Th elogin succeeds
   but access is limited to the operations of the device management, allowing to register and confirm the new device. 

   Suppressed device registration:</br>
   Insurants may temporary use an unregistered device to access the health record for entitlement of representatives.
   This is a typical case for insurants not using ePA-FdVs in general and delegating ePA access to one or more representatives.<br>
   A registration of the used device for the acting insurant is not intended and the device registration process is suppressed
   (skipped) before login completion.
   This special case is signaled by a specific parameter _authorize_representative_ in a _sendAuthorizationRequestFdV_ call.
   The login succeeds but access is limited to the entitlement management of the health record of the user.

- name: Authorization SMC-B
  description: |
   Authorization with a smartcard (SMC-B) equipped client of a health care institution and login to a health 
   record system.
   
   This authorization method addresses the central smartcard IDP.
   A successful login provides an IDToken and causes an authorized epa user session for the health care
   institution allowing access to several health records on demand.

   **Client Attestation**</br>
   The authorization flow uses client attestation to guarantee a match of IDP issued IDToken and
   the user's identity of the authenticated clients.

   A client first retrieves a nonce value from the authorization service. The nonce is signed with the 
   clients SMC-B and becomes the client attestation.</br>
   In a final sendAuthCodeSC operation the client attestion is compared by the authorization service 
   with the issued nonce value and attestation telematik-id matching ID-Token telematik-id is verified.    

   **Allowed usergroups for Authorization SMC-B**
   Authorization with SMC-B is limited to certain user roles: 
   The following list of allowed roles (professionOid) is for information only and may be incomplete, 
   the normative requirement is defined in A_23941-* (excluding oid_versicherter and oid_erp-vau).

   Allowed roles [professionOID] 
   - oid_praxis_arzt
   - oid_krankenhaus
   - oid_institution-vorsorge-reha
   - oid_zahnarztpraxis
   - oid_öffentliche_apotheke

- name: Authorization BearerToken
  description: |
   This interface method enables the authorization by a signed BearerToken only (no IDP interaction).
   This method is restricted for use by the ePrescription backend only.

- name: Search access-token for FHIR VZD
  description: | 
   A search access-token is required by clients to submit search queries to the directory service (FHIR VZD).
   Each health record system is registered as a client with the directory service and provides the associazted search 
   access-token for clients, thereby avoiding the individual registration of each client towards the directory service.

        After successful user authentication the authorization code grant was returned to the authorization 
        service, that is exchanged for an ID token at the IDP's token endpoint using this operation.
        This operation is limited to users of the "Allowed usergroups for Authorization SMC-B"

        The authorization service shall further validate the ID-token against the stored nonce (from a preceding _getNonce_ operation)
        and the client attestation:
        - _clientAttest_ is valid if
          - signature is valid
          - "iat" is a timestamp in the interval 'current time - 20 min' and 'current time'.
          - user has role as in "Allowed usergroups for Authorization SMC-B" (from signature cert)
        - stored nonce shall not be outdated
        - stored nonce shall match client attestation nonce
        - Telematik-Id of client attestation (from signature cert) shall match the telematik-id claim of the ID-Token 

        The user session of the client shall be closed and all session related data shall be deleted in case operation is not successful.

        The nonce shall be discarded, i.e. reuse of a client attestation for user session establishment shall be rejected.

        npa + pin only and limit the possible operations to entitlement management only.
        A client shall use the returned redirect url to invoke the authenticator. 
       
        **Provider**:</br>
        The authorization service shall send a pushed authorization request (PAR) to the IDP (see: find more details).

        The authorize representative situation (_x-authorize_representative_ == _true_) shall be kept for the subsequent
        _sendAuthCodeFdV_ and device management operations. For this case the PAR for the IDP shall include:
        - amr = urn:telematik:auth:eGK or urn:telematik:auth:eID

        The authorization service' state value and clientid used for the PAR shall occur in the URI-PAR response of the IDP.

        Send the authorization code to the authorization service to complete the login and (optional)
        verify the device registration.

        **Client**:</br>
        A client shall always send the authorization code received from the authenticator / IDP. 

        A client shall send _x-device-identifier_ and _x-device-token_ if device used is already registered..

        A client shall not send _x-device-identifier_ and _x-device-token_ (suppress parameters at all) if the
        device is not yet registered and confirmed or if the preceding _sendAuthorizationRequestFdV_ call 
        includes the parameter _x-authorize_representative_ == _true_.

        (For registration of a new device, including confirmation of the registration, see Device Management 
        Service operations _registerDevice_ and _confirmDevice_). 
        

        **Provider**:</br>
        The provided authorization code shall be exchanged for an IDToken with the IDP. The IDToken shall be converted
        into a HSM-ID-Token with an extended validity period.
        
        Device verification:</br>
        If _x-device-identifier_ and _x-device-token_ are both submitted the device verification starts immediately after
        the authorization completion.
        Device identifier and -token shall be verified with the registered values.
        The x-device-identifier / x-device-token check shall only consider device registrations for the authorized user.

        On success (IDToken / HSM-ID-Token reveived and device binding check successful) a new user session shall be instantiated, 
        associated to the HSM-ID-Token.

        If device verification succeeds, access to all services of a health record shall be possible for the associated
        user session.
        if x-authorize-representative is set, access to the user's health record entitlement management only shall be
        possible for the user session.
        In all other (success cases) access of the user session shall be limited to the device management service.

        The user session of a client shall be closed and all session related data shall be deleted in case operation is not successful.
